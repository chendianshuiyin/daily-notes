# Flutter & Dart Best Practices

## Flutter style guide
* **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase.
* **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, technical Dart code.
  Prefer functional and declarative patterns.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex
  widgets and logic.
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. Widgets (especially
  `StatelessWidget`) should be immutable.
* **State Management:** Separate ephemeral state and app state. Use a state
  management solution for app state to handle the separation of concerns.
* **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose
  complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets.
* **Navigation:** Use a modern routing package like `auto_route` or `go_router`.

## Code Quality
* **Code structure:** Adhere to maintainable code structure and separation of
  concerns (e.g., UI logic separate from business logic).
* **Naming conventions:** Avoid abbreviations and use meaningful, consistent,
  descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
* **Conciseness:** Write code that is as short as it can be while remaining
  clear.
* **Simplicity:** Write straightforward code. Code that is clever or
  obscure is difficult to maintain.
* **Error Handling:** Anticipate and handle potential errors. Don't let your
  code fail silently.
* **Styling:**
    * Line length: Lines should be 80 characters or fewer.
    * Use `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for
      members/variables/functions/enums, and `snake_case` for files.
* **Functions:**
    * Functions short and with a single purpose (strive for less than 20 lines).
* **Testing:** Write code with testing in mind. Use the `file`, `process`, and
  `platform` packages, if appropriate, so you can inject in-memory and fake
  versions of the objects.
* **Logging:** Use the `logging` package instead of `print`.

## Dart Best Practices
* **Effective Dart:** Follow the official Effective Dart guidelines
  (https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
* **Class Organization:** Define related classes within the same library file.
  For large libraries, export smaller, private libraries from a single top-level
  library.
* **Library Organization:** Group related libraries in the same folder.
* **API Documentation:** Add documentation comments to all public APIs,
  including classes, constructors, methods, and top-level functions.
* **Comments:** Write clear comments for complex or non-obvious code. Avoid
  over-commenting.
* **Trailing Comments:** Don't add trailing comments.
* **Async/Await:** Ensure proper use of `async`/`await` for asynchronous
  operations with robust error handling.
    * Use `Future`s, `async`, and `await` for asynchronous operations.
    * Use `Stream`s for sequences of asynchronous events.
* **Null Safety:** Write code that is soundly null-safe. Leverage Dart's null
  safety features. Avoid `!` unless the value is guaranteed to be non-null.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use pattern matching features where they simplify the
  code.
* **Records:** Use records to return multiple types in situations where defining
  an entire class is cumbersome.
* **Switch Statements:** Prefer using exhaustive `switch` statements or
  expressions, which don't require `break` statements.
* **Exception Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks for handling exceptions, and
  use exceptions appropriate for the type of exception. Use custom exceptions
  for situations specific to your code.
* **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow syntax for simple one-line functions.

## Flutter Best Practices
* **Immutability:** Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) are immutable; when
  the UI needs to change, Flutter rebuilds the widget tree.
* **Composition:** Prefer composing smaller widgets over extending existing
  ones. Use this to avoid deep widget nesting.
* **Private Widgets:** Use small, private `Widget` classes instead of private
  helper methods that return a `Widget`.
* **Build Methods:** Break down large `build()` methods into smaller, reusable
  private Widget classes.
* **List Performance:** Use `ListView.builder` or `SliverList` for long lists to
  create lazy-loaded lists for performance.
* **Isolates:** Use `compute()` to run expensive calculations in a separate
  isolate to avoid blocking the UI thread, such as JSON parsing.
* **Const Constructors:** Use `const` constructors for widgets and in `build()`
  methods whenever possible to reduce rebuilds.
* **Build Method Performance:** Avoid performing expensive operations, like
  network calls or complex computations, directly within `build()` methods.

## API Design Principles
When building reusable APIs, such as a library, follow these principles.

* **Consider the User:** Design APIs from the perspective of the person who will
  be using them. The API should be intuitive and easy to use correctly.
* **Documentation is Essential:** Good documentation is a part of good API
  design. It should be clear, concise, and provide examples.

## Accessibility (A11Y)
Implement accessibility features to empower all users, assuming a wide variety
of users with different physical abilities, mental abilities, age groups,
education levels, and learning styles.

* **Color Contrast:** Ensure text has a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1**
  against its background.
* **Dynamic Text Scaling:** Test your UI to ensure it remains usable when users
  increase the system font size.
* **Semantic Labels:** Use the `Semantics` widget to provide clear, descriptive
  labels for UI elements.
* **Screen Reader Testing:** Regularly test your app with TalkBack (Android) and
  VoiceOver (iOS).
