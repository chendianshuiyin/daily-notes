# Flutter Architecture & State Management

## Application Architecture
* **Separation of Concerns:** Aim for separation of concerns similar to MVC/MVVM, with defined Model,
  View, and ViewModel/Controller roles.
* **Logical Layers:** Organize the project into logical layers:
    * Presentation (widgets, screens)
    * Domain (business logic classes)
    * Data (model classes, API clients)
    * Core (shared classes, utilities, and extension types)
* **Feature-based Organization:** For larger projects, organize code by feature,
  where each feature has its own presentation, domain, and data subfolders. This
  improves navigability and scalability.

## State Management
* **Built-in Solutions:** Prefer Flutter's built-in state management solutions.
  Do not use a third-party package unless explicitly requested.
* **Streams:** Use `Streams` and `StreamBuilder` for handling a sequence of
  asynchronous events.
* **Futures:** Use `Futures` and `FutureBuilder` for handling a single
  asynchronous operation that will complete in the future.
* **ValueNotifier:** Use `ValueNotifier` with `ValueListenableBuilder` for
  simple, local state that involves a single value.

  ```dart
  // Define a ValueNotifier to hold the state.
  final ValueNotifier<int> _counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0);

  // Use ValueListenableBuilder to listen and rebuild.
  ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
    valueListenable: _counter,
    builder: (context, value, child) {
      return Text('Count: $value');
    },
  );
    ```

* **ChangeNotifier:** For state that is more complex or shared across multiple
  widgets, use `ChangeNotifier`.
* **ListenableBuilder:** Use `ListenableBuilder` to listen to changes from a
  `ChangeNotifier` or other `Listenable`.
* **MVVM:** When a more robust solution is needed, structure the app using the
  Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
* **Dependency Injection:** Use simple manual constructor dependency injection
  to make a class's dependencies explicit in its API, and to manage dependencies
  between different layers of the application.
* **Provider:** If a dependency injection solution beyond manual constructor
  injection is explicitly requested, `provider` can be used to make services,
  repositories, or complex state objects available to the UI layer without tight
  coupling (note: this document generally defaults against third-party packages
  for state management unless explicitly requested).

## Data Flow
* **Data Structures:** Define data structures (classes) to represent the data
  used in the application.
* **Data Abstraction:** Abstract data sources (e.g., API calls, database
  operations) using Repositories/Services to promote testability.

## Routing
* **GoRouter:** Use the `go_router` package for declarative navigation, deep
  linking, and web support.
* **GoRouter Setup:** To use `go_router`, first add it to your `pubspec.yaml`
  using the `pub` tool's `add` command.

  ```dart
  // 1. Add the dependency
  // flutter pub add go_router

  // 2. Configure the router
  final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
    routes: <RouteBase>[
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
        routes: <RouteBase>[
          GoRoute(
            path: 'details/:id', // Route with a path parameter
            builder: (context, state) {
              final String id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
              return DetailScreen(id: id);
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  );

  // 3. Use it in your MaterialApp
  MaterialApp.router(
    routerConfig: _router,
  );
  ```
* **Authentication Redirects:** Configure `go_router`'s `redirect` property to
  handle authentication flows, ensuring users are redirected to the login screen
  when unauthorized, and back to their intended destination after successful
  login.

* **Navigator:** Use the built-in `Navigator` for short-lived screens that do
  not need to be deep-linkable, such as dialogs or temporary views.

  ```dart
  // Push a new screen onto the stack
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const DetailsScreen()),
  );

  // Pop the current screen to go back
  Navigator.pop(context);
  ```

## Data Handling & Serialization
* **JSON Serialization:** Use `json_serializable` and `json_annotation` for
  parsing and encoding JSON data.
* **Field Renaming:** When encoding data, use `fieldRename: FieldRename.snake`
  to convert Dart's camelCase fields to snake_case JSON keys.

  ```dart
  // In your model file
  import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

  part 'user.g.dart';

  @JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake)
  class User {
    final String firstName;
    final String lastName;

    User({required this.firstName, required this.lastName});

    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
    Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
  }
  ```
