# Flutter Tooling & Environment

## Package Management
* **Pub Tool:** To manage packages, use the `pub` tool, if available.
* **External Packages:** If a new feature requires an external package, use the
  `pub_dev_search` tool, if it is available. Otherwise, identify the most
  suitable and stable package from pub.dev.
* **Adding Dependencies:** To add a regular dependency, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available. Otherwise, run `flutter pub add <package_name>`.
* **Adding Dev Dependencies:** To add a development dependency, use the `pub`
  tool, if it is available, with `dev:<package name>`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add dev:<package_name>`.
* **Dependency Overrides:** To add a dependency override, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available, with `override:<package name>:1.0.0`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add override:<package_name>:1.0.0`.
* **Removing Dependencies:** To remove a dependency, use the `pub` tool, if it
  is available. Otherwise, run `dart pub remove <package_name>`.

## Lint Rules

Include the package in the `analysis_options.yaml` file. Use the following
analysis_options.yaml file as a starting point:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    # Add additional lint rules here:
    # avoid_print: false
    # prefer_single_quotes: true
```

## Logging
* **Structured Logging:** Use the `log` function from `dart:developer` for
  structured logging that integrates with Dart DevTools.

  ```dart
  import 'dart:developer' as developer;

  // For simple messages
  developer.log('User logged in successfully.');

  // For structured error logging
  try {
    // ... code that might fail
  } catch (e, s) {
    developer.log(
      'Failed to fetch data',
      name: 'myapp.network',
      level: 1000, // SEVERE
      error: e,
      stackTrace: s,
    );
  }
  ```

## Code Generation
* **Build Runner:** If the project uses code generation, ensure that
  `build_runner` is listed as a dev dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
* **Code Generation Tasks:** Use `build_runner` for all code generation tasks,
  such as for `json_serializable`.
* **Running Build Runner:** After modifying files that require code generation,
  run the build command:

  ```shell
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

## Documentation

* **`dartdoc`:** Write `dartdoc`-style comments for all public APIs.


### Documentation Philosophy

* **Comment wisely:** Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain
  way, not what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
* **Document for the user:** Write documentation with the reader in mind. If you
  had a question and found the answer, add it to the documentation where you
  first looked. This ensures the documentation answers real-world questions.
* **No useless documentation:** If the documentation only restates the obvious
  from the code's name, it's not helpful. Good documentation provides context
  and explains what isn't immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is key:** Use consistent terminology throughout your
  documentation.

### Commenting Style

* **Use `///` for doc comments:** This allows documentation generation tools to
  pick them up.
* **Start with a single-sentence summary:** The first sentence should be a
  concise, user-centric summary ending with a period.
* **Separate the summary:** Add a blank line after the first sentence to create
  a separate paragraph. This helps tools create better summaries.
* **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat information that's obvious from the code's
  context, like the class name or signature.
* **Don't document both getter and setter:** For properties with both, only
  document one. The documentation tool will treat them as a single field.

### Writing Style

* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms:** Don't use abbreviations unless they are widely
  understood.
* **Use Markdown sparingly:** Avoid excessive markdown and never use HTML for
  formatting.
* **Use backticks for code:** Enclose code blocks in backtick fences, and
  specify the language.

### What to Document

* **Public APIs are a priority:** Always document public APIs.
* **Consider private APIs:** It's a good idea to document private APIs as well.
* **Library-level comments are helpful:** Consider adding a doc comment at the
  library level to provide a general overview.
* **Include code samples:** Where appropriate, add code samples to illustrate usage.
* **Explain parameters, return values, and exceptions:** Use prose to describe
  what a function expects, what it returns, and what errors it might throw.
* **Place doc comments before annotations:** Documentation should come before
  any metadata annotations.
